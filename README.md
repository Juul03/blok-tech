# Plant Parents
Welcome to my repository of Plant Parents. This is a feature build in a 6 week study program in the second year of the bachelor Communication and Multimedia Design (CMD) at HvA.

## What is Plant Parents?
Plant Parents is a matching application whereby plant owners can upload their plants to sell them to new owners. Plants can be found by filtering on specific information, such as planttype, height, environmental preferences and skill-level.

The feature focusses on uploading a plant to the database with all the specific information needed and displaying it on a global feed.

The application is build for mobile screens and looks the best on a 430px wide screen.
